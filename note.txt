                            REACT
WHY REACT?
    -it is just better
    -not prone to so much bugs
    -there are pre build hooks and stuff which make the job easier 


JSX 
    -JS sytax
    -writing HTML in js is known as JSX
    -we cant directly do that as the browser engine does not allow us to do that  
    -so we need to convert this JSX into seperate files and stuff --- thats basicaly what the scripts in the react  hwlp us do 
    -jsx is not supported in the browsern --- so it getts converted by the devlopmetn server
    -react shortens the code while compinling it 

REACT-scripts
    -these scrpits are what convert the code actaully
    -vite has its own scripts and engines 
    - CRA has its own build process to convert react code into normal exicutable code
    -VITE has its own buil dprocesses to convert react code into exicutable js


                COMPONENTS

-reusable Building Blocks
-we dont have to make chages in a lot of places
