                            REACT
WHY REACT?
    -it is just better
    -not prone to so much bugs
    -there are pre build hooks and stuff which make the job easier 


JSX 
    -JS sytax
    -writing HTML in js is known as JSX
    -we cant directly do that as the browser engine does not allow us to do that  
    -so we need to convert this JSX into seperate files and stuff --- thats basicaly what the scripts in the react  hwlp us do 
    -jsx is not supported in the browsern --- so it getts converted by the devlopmetn server
    -react shortens the code while compinling it 

REACT-scripts
    -these scrpits are what convert the code actaully
    -vite has its own scripts and engines 
    - CRA has its own build process to convert react code into normal exicutable code
    -VITE has its own buil dprocesses to convert react code into exicutable js


                COMPONENTS

-it is just a Function
-reusable Building Blocks
-we dont have to make chages in a lot of places

        1. It should return a renderble value
        2. Function Name should start with a capital Letter

-INSIDE OF COMPOENTS THE FILE PATHS
-the path is relative to the location of the HTML file that includes your React application

-components can be written either way in one word syntax and two word syntx


OUTPUTTING CONTENT DYNAMICALLY

    -you can use JS in the HTML by using the Curly braaces notation
    -   {}      everyting in there will be used to build dynamically usabel shit


PROPS**


    -concept of configuring components is called props 
    -any kind of value can be passes as a prop to the function 

    -PROPS keyword is used to recieve value from the CallBack
    -we dont necessarly have to name props props while recienving the value from the call back but as a part of the general syntax it ends up being named as props 

    -PROPS will pass an Object to the function -- we can acess the data from the callback directly here like -- props.name (we use the name we have named the input in the attribute in the callback --- acessing it like props.name)
