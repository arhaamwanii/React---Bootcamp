                            REACT
WHY REACT?
    -it is just better
    -not prone to so much bugs
    -there are pre build hooks and stuff which make the job easier 


JSX 
    -writing HTML in js is known as JSX
    -we cant directly do that as the browser engine does not allow us to do that  
    -so we need to convert this JSX into seperate files and stuff --- thats basicaly what the scripts in the react  hwlp us do 

    -react shortens the code while compinling it
