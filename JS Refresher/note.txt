    IMPORT AND EXPORT   
    
    -in normal vanilla JS we have to specify the file etension of the file as well
    -in case of react, react does it for us

    -we also have to use "type=module"  ---- thsi ensures the usage of es6 and its newly introduced function

    EXPORT DEFAULT
    -you can only export a single deault from an file\
    -you dont name it you just put in the value 

    we decide its name in the file when we import it -- we can name it different in every file
